## Skills

#### Problem-solving

My analytical and critical thinking skills allow me to break down and understand complex problems, and my ability to think creatively allows me to come up with effective solutions. I have a track record of successfully identifying and resolving issues in a variety of contexts, whether it be in technical or non-technical settings. 

The orchestration of a graduation ceremony for over 2000 attendees presented a multifaceted challenge, requiring a high degree of problem-solving acumen. As a member of a small, yet dedicated team, I assumed a leadership role in the coordination of the event and its ultimate success. The stringent time constraints imposed upon us necessitated the implementation of a methodical system of division of labor among team members. I strategically assigned specific areas of responsibility, such as the procurement of provisions, engagement of guest speakers, regulation of parking, and oversight of security. This approach not only enabled us to maximise our resources and capitalise on the strengths of team members, but also afforded us the ability to proactively anticipate and swiftly address any potential issues that may have arisen. Through my ability to dissect and tackle each problem individually, and my proficiency in delegating tasks effectively, the ceremony transpired seamlessly, a testament to the efficacy of my problem-solving skills.

#### Communication

I am a highly skilled communicator, with a proven ability to convey complex information in a clear and easy-to-understand manner. I have honed these skills through my experience as a school department lead and liaison with teachers, as well as my research background in finance. My time as a jurist required me to present legal arguments and research findings clearly and persuasively, while my experience in researching for an investment fund required me to break down technical financial and economic terms for laymen.

My communication skills are further exemplified through my leadership in team meetings, and my ability to keep team members informed and up-to-date on progress, and my ability to identify potential issues and provide solutions. This is demonstrated throughout my time leading and coordinating teams, including the organization of a graduation ceremony for over 2000 attendees, showcasing my clear and effective communication skills. I am comfortable communicating with both technical and non-technical individuals, and my strong analytical and research skills coupled with my proficiency in communication make me a valuable asset for any organisation.
